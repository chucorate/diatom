## Installation
This project uses **uv** for Python dependency management, **Gurobi** as an external LP solver, and **Jupyter notebooks** for analysis.

### Requirements
- Python >= 3.10.
- Gurobi Optimizer installed and a valid license.
- If `uv` is not already installed, check the [official installation guide](<https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>) for instructions.

### Setup
Clone the repository. From the project's root, run:
```
uv sync
```
This will create a local virtual environment in `.venv/` and install all Python dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`.
